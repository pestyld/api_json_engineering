# Exploring Data from the World Bank API with SAS or Python: Retrieval, Transformation, and Visualization

## Requirements
- Access to SAS9 or SAS Viya.

## Description
In this workshop, you will learn how to use Python or SAS to interact with the World Bank's REST API, retrieve data in JSON format, and transform it into a structured DataFrame. The example was divided into three sections:

## Introduction
You will learn how to

- **Request to the World Bank API**: Using Python, access the World Bank's REST API to fetch data using the requests library.

- **Data Transformation**: This involves parsing a valid JSON string and converting it into a usable format. Then converting it into a structured table. Lastly, using SAS or Python, perform final transformations on the table, making it available for further analysis.

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**: With the final table, perform simple analysis and visualizations.
